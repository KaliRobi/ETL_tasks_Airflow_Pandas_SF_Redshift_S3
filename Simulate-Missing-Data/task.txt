Task 5: Simulating Missing Data and Imputation Strategies 

Goal: Introduce missing values and practice different imputation techniques. 

Steps: 

    Randomly drop values in surface_temperature_K and planet_mass_jupiter_units. 

    Implement different imputation methods:  

    Fill surface_temperature_K with the mean of similar planets (grouped by detection_method). 

    Fill planet_mass_jupiter_units using a predictive regression model. 

    Compare the before and after statistics to evaluate the impact of imputation.
