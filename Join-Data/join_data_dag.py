# 3. Industry-Wide ESG Benchmarking

# "We want to compare ESG performance across industries. Generate:

#     The average environmental score per industry.
#     The total sustainability budget per country.
#     Insights on whether any industries significantly lag behind in governance scores."_

# 4. Sustainability Trend Analysis

# "Weâ€™re analyzing how companies have progressed in renewable energy adoption. Please identify:

#     Companies whose renewable energy usage has increased over the years.
#     Whether companies with a net-zero target of 2030 have lower emissions than those targeting 2050.
#     Any industry-wide patterns in carbon emissions reduction."_

# 5. Investment & Strategy Insights

# "We need a new internal sustainability index to rank companies.
# Create a scoring system that considers:

#     High environmental scores
#     Low carbon emissions
#     High renewable energy usage
#     Higher sustainability budgets

# Rank companies based on this new metric and highlight any high-risk companies that score poorly."_
# 6. Anomaly Detection for Auditing

# "We suspect some companies are reporting inconsistent sustainability data. Please identify:

#     Companies with unusually high emissions compared to their industry average.
#     Any companies spending significantly less on sustainability than expected for their emissions levels.
#     Any companies with drastic ESG score changes that might indicate reporting inconsistencies."_
