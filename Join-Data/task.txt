ESG Performance Report for Leadership

"We need an overview of our ESG scores and company distribution. Please provide:

    The number of companies in each industry.
    The top 10 companies with the highest environmental scores.
    A list of all energy sector companies rated A in ESG performance."_

2. Compliance & Risk Assessment

"Our compliance team needs a report identifying companies that failed to meet ESG reporting requirements.
Can you provide:

    A list of non-compliant companies.
    Their ESG ratings and total emissions for the latest available year.
    Any trends in compliance failures by industry."

        Are some industries consistently failing to report ESG data more often than others?
        Is non-compliance increasing or decreasing in specific industries over time?
        Are industries with low ESG scores also the ones failing compliance more frequently?

3. Industry-Wide ESG Benchmarking

"We want to compare ESG performance across industries. Generate:

    The average environmental score per industry.
    The total sustainability budget per country.
    Insights on whether any industries significantly lag behind in governance scores."_

4. Sustainability Trend Analysis

"Weâ€™re analyzing how companies have progressed in renewable energy adoption. Please identify:

    Companies whose renewable energy usage has increased over the years.
    Whether companies with a net-zero target of 2030 have lower emissions than those targeting 2050.
    Any industry-wide patterns in carbon emissions reduction."_

5. Investment & Strategy Insights

"We need a new internal sustainability index to rank companies.
Create a scoring system that considers:

    High environmental scores
    Low carbon emissions
    High renewable energy usage
    Higher sustainability budgets

Rank companies based on this new metric and highlight any high-risk companies that score poorly."_
6. Anomaly Detection for Auditing

"We suspect some companies are reporting inconsistent sustainability data. Please identify:

    Companies with unusually high emissions compared to their industry average.
    Any companies spending significantly less on sustainability than expected for their emissions levels.
    Any companies with drastic ESG score changes that might indicate reporting inconsistencies."_
